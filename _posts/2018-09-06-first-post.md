First, I want to thank Jonathan McGlone.  I used his guide on creating a github website.  The guide can be found [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

There are several projects that I'm interested in:

<ol>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>elliptic curve cryptography</li>
<li>Gross-Stark units
<li>perfectoid spaces.</li>
</ol>

I want to tackle these subjects in this priority.  Machine learning is well-known.  Elliptic curve cryptography is relatively well-known.  As for Gross-Stark units, my dissertation was on $p$-adic Gross-Stark units and I would like to flesh out the thesis.  I would also like to continue working on the problem.  Finally, perfectoid spaces are difficult to explain, because I know very little about them.

I hope to have some sort of framework for learning each of these projects, eventually.

I hope to have a post everyday, but reality pays no heed to our best intentions.
