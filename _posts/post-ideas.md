There are a number of topics that I want to cover. I want to keep my explanation of the topics as simple as possible. I am aiming for between a pre-calculus to an undergraduate math student. The difficulty in explaining these topics is that there is a lot of compressed information involved. But, most of the topics are used to describe very concrete (concrete in that you can compute answers numerically).

So, here is a short list of topics I am interested in writing about:
<ul>
	<li>number fields</li>
	<li>p-adic numbers</li>
	<li>Gauss's <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i></li>
	<li>elliptic curves</li>
	<li>categories, functors, and natural transformations</li>
	<li>measures</li>
	<li>zeta functions</li>
	<li>zeta functions in terms of p-adic measures</li>
</ul>

I think this is a good start.
